âœ“ Learner about advance numpy array techniques 
   - Appending array row wise with the help of
     np.append(first_array, second_array, axis=0)
     where axis=0 represent row wise stacking
   - Appending array column wise if second array
     is compatible which means it has same row as first.
   - Applied mean_squared_error with brute force 
     and simply with the use of numpy like directly
     doing ((y_true - y_pred)**2).sum().mean()
   - Used sklearn.metrics mean_squared_error module 
     to direct calculate mse.
   - Visualized in 3d gradient descent algorithm
     and realised how powerful and beautiful it is.
Tommorow, will be learning some techniques of data cleaning
     gathering and predicting some real estate prices in
     USA Boston area.
