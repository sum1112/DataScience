=> Started the classification algorithms
  => Learned two approaches to this problem
    => Probabilistic approach
    => Function based approach
=> In probability revised bayes theorem
  => Studied how it can be applied to classifying
     whether a email is spam or not
=> Function approach : Studied g(x) = 1/(1+e^-x)
   It's range varies from 0 to 1.
   So, If applied on some model it's value found
   out to be greater than 0.5, then result is 1 
   otherwise 0.
=> Learned the use of walk function in os module
   => Iterated entire folder to store all emails
      in it to the DataFrame.
   => Studied about function yield instead of return
      approach with it's use.
