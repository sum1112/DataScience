=> I was not able to make to right conclusion in the previous work.
  => Determing whether we can drop a feature just by observing its p-value and variation inflation factor 
  => Seeing p-value and vif only gives you an idea of how many different models you need to check altogether.
  => Inorder to compare two models we need to know Baysian information criterion.
    => Always a model having less Baysian information criterion is preferred.
    => Also check for the r-squared values of the two model so that we don't compromise on the fitted values.
 => Finally completed the working model for the boston dataset given in the sklearn.dataset module
    => It can predict prices of the houses in the boston area, also taken care of the inflation and other economic criterion effection house prices through scaling the medium of 
       prices in 1976 w.r.t todays medium (found from zillow.com).
    => Also predicted the range b/w the price can lie through the assumption that the residuls (predictedValues - actualValues) follows a normal distribution.
      => which means for 95% confidence value will be predicted value +- (2 * root_mean_squared_error)
      => for the 68% confidence value will be predicted value +- (root_mean_squared_error)
      => Skew of the residuals in log of the target value is less and also r-squared is more, so done the calculation on the log(target)
    => Formed docs for the function through the use of """ DOCS """ 
    => Finally imported this .py file and used it in the notebook
